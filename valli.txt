My name is Krishna Nagavalli.
I was currently pursuing B.SC Data science 3rd year.
One thing I learned about GitHub: GitHub tracks every change through commits, making it easy to see history.
With commits and version history, you can always see who made a change, when it happened, and even roll back to an earlier version if something breaks. 
This is I learned in the Git Hub.
